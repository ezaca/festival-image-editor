# Festival

A prototype for a web-based image editor focused on quick image editing, effects, layouts, design, and basic photo montages.

This application has deep inspiration in a commercial application made deprecated, intending to be a free option to it, if continued. For now, it is in the early stages of prototyping and idea validation.

[Run application in browser](https://ezaca.github.io/festival-image-editor/index.html)

## Build it yourself

Requirements:

- Visual Studio (>= 2019, Community);
- Bridge.NET [extension for Visual Studio](https://bridge.net/download/);
